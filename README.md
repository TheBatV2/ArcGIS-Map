# Overview

This is a basic ArcGIS map that I built using python and ported to the web as a web based app, it displays basic information on a few different attractions that a tourist might like to see in the city of Idaho Falls, Idaho. 


I designed this as a way of practicing my app development in python and applying it as a web based application.

Demonstration of application:

# Development Environment

I used VS code to develop this app.

I used OS, Logging and Flask, as inports in the app which is built in python and applied to a webpage using Html, JS, and CSS.
